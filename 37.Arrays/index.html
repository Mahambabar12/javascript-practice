    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    <p> 01. Javascript arrays are used to store multiple value in single variable <br>
        02. An array used to store a collection of data <br>
        03.It is an ordered collection which store elements in sequence <br>
        04 We can use array to store list of somethings like : <br>
        <li>student</li>
        <li>Cars</li>
        <li>Food items</li>
    </p>
    <br><br><hr>
    <p>01.Now what if you want to store temperature & evening for 7 days.That will be 14 variables. <br>
        02.How about temperature for a year morning and evening that 730. <br>
        03.It will be very difficult to mange and assign name to these variables.</p><br><br><hr>

    <p>01.If you want to find out all days temperature was above 30 then it will be quit difficult <br>
        02.If you want to short temperature in ascending r descending order that will not be possible with separate
        multiple variables.
    </p> <br><br><hr>
    <p>01.With array you can create single variable to hold all temperature in it. <br>
    02.With array you will be able to find and short temperature easily.
<li style="color: red;">let temperature = [34,12,7,67,90,,28];</li></p>
