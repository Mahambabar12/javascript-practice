    <h2>Logical Operators</h2>
    <p>Logical Operators are used to determine the logic between variable and value <br>
    02. Logical Operators required boolean operators on both side of operators <br>
03. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operator are used with on-boolean values, they will return a non-boolean values</p>
